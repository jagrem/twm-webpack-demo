# Tauranga Web Meetup Webpack 2 Demo #

## Example
This repo contains a simple step by step example of how to start using Webpack.
The aim here is not necessarily just to show you how to use Webpack but also to introduce some concepts that are useful for building modern web apps.


## Topics
In particular this example touches on:
- Bundling
- Transpilation
- Optimization using minification, etc.
- Dynamic module/code loading
- Extracting common code bundles

## Omissions
Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to talk about:
- Unit testing
- Bundling other assets, images, CSS, etc.
- CSS preprocessors like LESS
- Transpiling other languages like Typescript

## Disclaimer
I certainly am not claiming to be an expert on Webpack. I've got a few side projects up and running with it but I am not currently using Webpack in production so your mileage will definitely vary.

I do have a reasonable amount of experience using a wide variety of build tools for different environments and currently am using Browserify in production for much of what is presented in this example.

## Sources and helpful links
There are, as always, many different ways to skin this particular cat and I'd encourage you, if you're interested, to look at the other tools available like Browserify, Brunch, Broccoli and Rollup.

Survive JS is probably one of the best sources of documentation for Webpack beyond the official documentation.

I will add some links here later.
